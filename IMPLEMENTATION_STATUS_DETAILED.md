I have completed DIRECTIVE-019 by implementing the Hill-Climbing Optimizer in `src/optimizer/hillClimbing.ts`.

I have also created a test file at `src/__tests__/optimizer/hillClimbing.test.ts` with unit tests for this new functionality. Additionally, I've created a script `run-optimizer.ts` to manually verify the optimizer's behavior and "show the improvement" as requested by the directive.

Unfortunately, due to environment restrictions, I was unable to run the tests myself. The commands `npm install`, `npm test`, `npx tsc`, and `npm run build` are not available in this environment.

The implementation of the optimizer is complete and ready for testing in an environment with the necessary tools.
