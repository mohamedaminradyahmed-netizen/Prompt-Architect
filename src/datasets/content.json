    "expectedOutput": "Regular exercise is one of the most important habits you can develop for your overall health and wellbeing. When you exercise consistently, you strengthen your cardiovascular system, build muscle mass, improve your immune function, and enhance your mental health through the release of endorphins. Studies show that people who exercise regularly live longer, have better cognitive function, and report higher life satisfaction than those who are sedentary. Exercise doesn't have to be complicated or time-consuming - even simple activities like walking, swimming, or cycling for 30 minutes daily can provide significant health benefits.",

Think of it as a spreadsheet that is duplicated thousands of times across a network of computers, and the spreadsheet is regularly updated.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Digital information is stored in blocks\n2. Each block contains a timestamp and link to the previous block\n3. When a new block is created, it's shared across the network\n4. Computers in the network validate the new block\n5. Once validated, the block is added to the chain\n\nThe beauty of blockchain is that it's decentralized - no single person or organization controls it. Everyone can access the information, but no one can alter it without the network's consensus.\n\nBlockchain technology is the backbone of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but its applications extend far beyond digital currencies. Industries from healthcare to supply chain management are exploring blockchain solutions.",

    "expectedOutput": "Bella Vista: A Taste of Italy in Our Neighborhood\n\nLast weekend, my family and I tried the new Italian restaurant that opened on Main Street, and we were pleasantly surprised!\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, the cozy atmosphere transported us to a small trattoria in Tuscany. The exposed brick walls, warm lighting, and checkered tablecloths created the perfect ambiance.\n\nOur meal started with complimentary bruschetta - crispy bread topped with fresh tomatoes, basil, and a drizzle of olive oil. For the main course, I ordered the linguine alle vongole (linguine with clams), which was perfectly al dente with a light white wine sauce that didn't overpower the delicate seafood.\n\nMy husband had the osso buco, a traditional Milanese dish of braised veal shank that was fall-off-the-bone tender and served with saffron risotto. The kids enjoyed their margherita pizza with a thin, crispy crust and fresh mozzarella.\n\nWe finished our meal with tiramisu that was light, creamy, and not too sweet.\n\nService was attentive without being intrusive, and our server was knowledgeable about the menu and wine pairings.\n\nPrices are reasonable for the quality - our family of four spent around $120 including wine and dessert.\n\nOverall, Bella Vista is a wonderful addition to our neighborhood dining scene. Whether you're looking for a casual weeknight dinner or celebrating a special occasion, this charming Italian spot is worth visiting.\n\nRating: 4.5/5 stars\nPrice: $$ (Moderate)\nLocation: 123 Main Street\nHours: Tuesday-Sunday, 5-10 PM",
